# Sandbox-game
A small Unity2D solo game project.<br/>

# Why a sandbox game?
I always have enjoyed sandbox games like Terraria and Minecraft. I also remember playing a lot of Halo 3 Forge mode.<br/>
So the purpose of this game is to give the player the ability to create their own world (like in halo 3 forge mode) as well as have some surviver mode with a procedurally generated world with RPG elements (like in Terraria).<br/>

# Current Features
Cave generator<br/>
Inventory system<br/>

# Potential Features
A nice overworld generator which will include trees, mountains, plains, deserts, etc<br/>
Magic based weapons<br/>
Ability to craft new weapons and tools from lower tiered weapons and tools<br/>
